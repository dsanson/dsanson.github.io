     <p>“Frivolous Fictions”, in progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I explore the possibility of providing a non-commital paraphrase of quantification over fictional characters, along the lines of the non-commital paraphrase Kit Fine provides for quantification over possibilia. Building on this foundation, we can say that names for fictional characters are <em>weakly non-referring</em>, in Nathan Salmon’s sense. The resulting view nicely splits the middle between Fictional Realist views, that posit existing abstract fictional characters, and Fictionalist and Pretense Theoretic views, that maintain that names for fictional characters are <em>strongly non-referring</em>. But all is not rosy: the paraphrase is problematic in various ways, providing us with an opportunity to reflect more broadly on the metaphysical commitments of this sort of paraphrasing strategy, when applied to fiction, modality, and time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Possible worlds are maximal possibilities. But what kind of thing <em>is</em> a maximal possibility? Not a maximal individual: there are maximal possibilities that are not maximal individuals, because each maximal individual could have any one of several maximal properties. And not a maximal property: there are maximal possibilities that are not maximal properties, because each maximal property could be had by any one of many possible maximal individuals. So if you like your worlds concrete, you should say that they are maximal facts, and if you like your worlds abstract, you should say that they are maximal propositions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If reality is temporary, then reality changes, and if reality changes, the past has explanatory work to do, and it cannot do that work unless it is no longer real. This tells against the <em>Moving Now Theory</em>, the <em>Growing Block Theory</em>, and any form of <em>Presentism</em> that attempts to understand the past in terms of the present, including <em>Tensed Properties Presentism</em> and <em>Tensed Facts Presentism</em>. It tells in favor of a form <em>Presentism</em> that allows us to appeal to unreal past facts. I suggest that <em>Priorian Presentism</em>, conjoined with a certain way of understanding the role played by tense operators, is one such view.</p>

     <p>“<a href="http://files.davidsanson.com/research/worlds-enough-for-junk.pdf">Worlds Enough for Junk</a>,” under revision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>cap</em> is something that is not a proper part. A <em>junky</em> thing is not part of any cap. The existence of a single junky thing, <em>j</em>, entails the existence of an infinite upward hierarchy of junky things: each thing <em>j</em> is a proper part of, is itself a proper part of something else, which is proper part of something else… Can there be junky things? Against the backdrop of Lewis’s Modal Realism, it is hard to see how there could be: every possibility involves the existence of a world, and that world is a cap. But this can be overcome, by allowing that parts of possible worlds collectively represent complete possibilities. Thinking this through helps throw the Modal Realist’s project into sharper relief.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three plausible views—Presentism, Truthmaking, and Independence—form an inconsistent triad. By Presentism, all being is present being. By Truthmaking, all truth supervenes on being. By Independence, some past truths do not supervene on present being. Presentists must reject either Truthmaking or Independence. We survey and assess various attempts to do so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Presentists cannot account for facts about how things once were by treating them as special facts about how things now are. For example, the truth of the proposition that Arnold was pale depends not on the properties that Arnold presently has—like the property <em>having been pale</em>—but rather on the properties that Arnold once had—like the property <em>being pale</em>. For Presentists, tensed talk should be understood as a device for pointing beyond reality: beyond what is and how things are, to what was and how things were.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my dissertation, I tried to make sense of the view that the facts that constitute reality—the facts about what there is, and what properties things instantiate—are temporary facts. But I don’t that’s quite how I put it at the time. The core of the dissertation is the argument in “Once Present, Now Past”. It also contains a critical discussion of one interpretation of the view Michael Tooley defends in <em>Time, Tense, and Causation</em> (1997). On that interpretation, Tooley’s view—that we can understand temporary facts only by supposing that reality is fundamentally relative to times—ends up looking a lot like the “external relativism” that Kit Fine describes in “Tense and Reality” (2005).</p>

                <p><em>Source: Anscombe, G. E. M. 1975. “The First Person.” In</em> Mind and Language, <em>edited by Samuel Guttenplan. Oxford University Press.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>It seems clear that if “I” is a ‘referring expression’ at all, it has both kinds of guaranteed reference. The object an “I-user means by it must exist so long as he is using”I“, nor can he take the wrong object to be the object he means by”I“. (The bishop may take the lady’s knee for his, but could he take the lady herself to be himself?)</p>
<p>(This is appropriate, because people surely have here the idea of a sort of pure direct reference in which one simply first means and then refers to an object before one.) It seems, then, that this reference could only be sure-fire if the referent of “I” were both freshly defined with each use of “I”, and also remained in view so long as something was being taken to be I. Even so there is an assumption that something else does not surreptitiously take its place. Perhaps we should say: such an assumption is extremely safe for “I”, and it would be altogether an excess of scepticism to doubt it! So we accept the assumption, and it seems to follow that what “I” stands for must be a Cartesian Ego.</p>
<p>For, let us suppose that it is some other object. A plausible one would be this body. And now imagine that I get into a state of ‘sensory deprivation’. Sight is cut off, and I am locally anaesthetized everywhere, perhaps floated in a tank of tepid water; I am unable to speak, or to touch any part of my body with any other. Now I tell myself “I won’t let this happen again!” If the object meant by “I” is this body, this human being, then in these circumstances it won’t be present to my senses; and how else can it be ‘present to’ me? But have I lost what I mean by “I” ? Is that not present to me? Am I reduced to, as it were, ‘referring in absence’? I have not lost my ‘selfconsciousness’; nor can what I mean by “I” be an object no longer present to me. This both seems right in itself, and will be required by the ‘guaranteed reference’ that we are considering.</p>
<p>Like considerations will operate for other suggestions. Nothing but a Cartesian Ego will serve. Or, rather, a stretch of one. People have sometimes queried how Descartes could conclude to his <em>RES cogitans</em>.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> But this is to forget that Descartes declares its essence to be nothing but thinking. The thinking that thinks this thought - that is what is guaranteed by “cogito”.</p>
<p>Thus we discover that if “I” is a referring expression, then Descartes was right about what the referent was. His position has, however, the intolerable dilficulty of requiring an identification of the same referent in different “I-thoughts. (This led Russell at one point to speak of ‘short-term selves’.)</p>
<p>Our questions were a combined reductio ad absurdum of the idea of “I” as a word whose role is to ‘make a singular reference’. I mean the questions how one is guaranteed to get the object right, whether one may safely assume no unnoticed substitution, whether one could refer to oneself ‘in absence’, and so on. The suggestion of getting the object right collapses into absurdity when we work it out and try to describe how getting hold of the wrong object may be excluded.</p>
<p>How, even, could one justify the assumption, if it is an assumption, that there is just one thinking which is this thinking of this thought that I am thinking, just one thinker? How do I know that ‘I’ is not ten thinkers thinking in unison? Or perhaps not quite succeeding. That might account for the confusion of thought which I sometimes feel. - Consider the reply “Legion, for we are many”, given by the possessed man in the gospel. Perhaps we should take that solemnly, not as a grammatical joke.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>

<li id="fn2"><p>Ambrose Bierce has a pleasant entry under “I” in the <em>Devil’s Dictionary</em>: “I is the first letter of the alphabet, the first word of the language, the first thought of the mind, the first object of the affections. In grammar it is a pronoun of the first person and singular number. Its plural is said to be <em>We</em>, but how there can be more than one myself is doubtless clearer to the grammarians than it is to the author of this incomparable dictionary. Conception of two myselves is difficult, but fine. The frank yet graceful use of”I&quot; distinguishes a good author from a bad; the latter carries it with the manner of a thief trying to cloak his loot.&quot;<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>

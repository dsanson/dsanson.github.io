<p><strong>You cannot attempt a level two assignment until you have received a “Complete” on a level one assignment.</strong></p>
<p>You paper should be between 400 and 600 words. It should be double-spaced, in a reasonable font, with at least 1 inch margins on all sides.</p>
<p>This paper should be just like a level 1 paper, except that you need to explain <em>two</em> arguments from the reading that have some important relationship to each other. For example, you might choose to discuss an argument and then another argument that is an objection to the first. Or, you might choose a second argument that builds on the first argument. There are other possibilities as well — the only requirement is that the two came from the readings and have some interesting relationship to one another.</p>
<p>As before, present each argument in premise-conclusion form. As before, for each argument, briefly explain how the conclusion is supposed to follow from the premises.</p>
<p>In addition, briefly explain <em>how the two arguments are related</em>. Examples might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second argument is meant to show that premise (3) of the first argument is false, and so that the first argument is not sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Premise (3) of the second argument is the conclusion of the first argument. So the second argument takes us further, suggesting that if we accept the conclusion of the first argument, then we must also accept…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper will be more complex than your level one paper. So include an introductory paragraph that briefly explains what your paper is going to be about how it will proceed.</p>

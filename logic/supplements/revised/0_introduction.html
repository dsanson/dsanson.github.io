<p>“<em>Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell.</em>” — Sherlock Holmes</p>
</div>
<h1 id="what-is-logic">What is Logic?</h1>
<p><strong>Logic</strong> is the study of correct and incorrect reasoning. Logicians want to understand what makes good reasoning good and what makes bad reasoning bad. Understanding this helps us to avoid making mistakes in our own reasoning, and it allows us to evaluate the reasoning of others. It makes us better thinkers.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>The <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/">first logician was Aristotle</a> (384-322 BCE). But the logic we use and study these days—sometimes called “Modern Logic” or “Contemporary Logic”—was developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Important early works include George Boole’s <em><a href="http://gutenberg.org/ebooks/15114">The Laws of Thought</a></em> (1854), and <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege/">Gottlob Frege</a>’s <em>Begriffsschrift</em> (“Concept Script”) (1879) and <em>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik</em> (“Basic Laws of Arithmetic) (1892).</p>

<p>Logic lies at the foundation of mathematics, where it allows us to provide a clear and rigorous account of mathematical proof. It also plays a central role in philosophy, where we use it to help us reason as clearly and rigorously as possible about hard questions about ourselves, about knowledge, reality, truth, and beauty, and about right and wrong, good and bad. It also lies at the foundation of computer science: a computer is a logic machine. And a mind is, at least in part, a logic machine too, so logic lies at the foundation of cognitive science and philosophy of mind. It also lies at the foundation of linguistics, providing the tools we use for thinking about linguistic structure (syntax) and linguistic meaning (semantics).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../../images/frege.jpg" alt="Gottlob Frege (1848-1925)" />
<p class="caption">Gottlob Frege (1848-1925)</p>
</div>
<p>Logic is one of the <a href="../../../handouts/brief-overview-of-areas-of-philosophy.html">traditional sub-disciplines of Philosophy</a> and one of the seven traditional “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_liberal_arts#Seven_liberal_arts">liberal arts</a>”, alongside arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, grammar, and rhetoric. In a medieval university, students would begin by studying grammar, logic, and rhetoric, before going on to study the four other liberal arts. Advanced students might then study philosophy and theology. (At the time, “philosophy” included disciplines we would now categorize as “sciences”, like physics, biology, and psychology.)</p>
<p>So there are many good reasons to study logic. It will make you more medieval. It will give you insight into linguistics, the foundations of mathematics, and computer science. It will make you a better philosopher. And it will make you a better thinker.</p>
<p>Also, it can be a lot of fun.</p>
<h1 id="representing-reasoning">Representing Reasoning</h1>
<p>Logic aims to develop a theory of good and bad reasoning. But before we can evaluate a given piece of reasoning, we need a way to represent it.</p>
<h2 id="the-structure-of-reasoning">The Structure of Reasoning</h2>
<p>When we reason, we reason <em>from</em> some given information <em>to</em> some new information. We might represent this using a visual diagram:</p>

<p>So, for example, given the information that Andrew is vegetarian, you might reason to the conclusion that Andrew does not eat chicken:</p>

<p>But this diagram leaves a lot of important information out. When you reasoned from the premise to the conclusion, you relied your background knowledge about vegetarians and chickens. This gave you additional information, and so additional premises. Here is a more explicit representation of your reasoning:</p>

<p>When we reason from some premises to more than one conclusion, it is always possible to represent the reasoning in this way, with separate arguments. So, for the sake of simplicity, we will do this, and assume that an argument always has exactly one conclusion.</p>
<p>These diagrams provide a nice visual way of representing arguments. We began with them to help emphasize the basic structure of an argument: an argument is a piece of reasoning, from some given information, to a conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="premise-conclusion-form">Premise-Conclusion Form</h2>
<p>In practice, it is much easier to represent an argument as a simple list: first the premises, followed by the conclusion. So, for example, we can represent the argument above as,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Alice, Bob, and Christina are teammates.</li>
<li>Alice is the tallest player on her team.</li>
<li>∴ Alice is taller than Christina.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here the premises are (1) and (2), and the conclusion is (3). We know that (3) is the conclusion because it is the last sentence in the list. We also know that it is the conclusion because it is marked by a special symbol, ‘∴’ which stands for “therefore”. We will always mark conclusions using ‘∴’.</p>
<p>When we represent arguments like this—as a list of premises, followed by the conclusion—we say that we have put the argument in <strong>premise-conclusion form</strong>. Putting arguments in premise-conclusion form is a common philosophical exercise. It forces you to clearly separate out the premises and the conclusion.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p><strong>Test Your Understanding</strong></p>
<p>Research shows that it is easy to read something and feel like you understood it, even when you didn’t. Most of us feel like we understand so long as we know what most of the words in a sentence mean, even if we don’t really grasp the ideas being communicated.</p>
<p>So, throughout these supplements, you will be provided with opportunities to stop and test your understanding. Please don’t skip this. If you get a question wrong, go back and re-read the preceding paragraphs with an eye to figuring out what you missed.</p>
</div>
<p>Arguments are everywhere. You can find them in blogs, magazine articles, textbooks, and newspaper editorials. They often pop up in conversations. But they are not usually found in premise-conclusion form, and important premises are often left unstated. Sometimes even the conclusion is left unstated, as in this example, from Confucius:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there be righteousness in the heart,<br />there will be beauty in the character.<br />If there be beauty in the character,<br />there will be harmony in the home.<br />If there be harmony in the home,<br />there will be order in the nation.<br />If there be order in the nation,<br />there will be peace in the world.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you put this argument in premise-conclusion form? What is the conclusion? When you think you know the answer, click on the gray box below.</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>Presumably the conclusion is,</p>
<ul>
<li>If there be righteousness in the heart, there will be peace in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the argument, in premise-conclusion form, would be,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If there be righteousness in the heart, there will be beauty in the character.</li>
<li>If there be beauty in the character, there will be harmony in the home.</li>
<li>If there be harmony in the home, there will be order in the nation.</li>
<li>If there be order in the nation, there will be peace in the world.</li>
<li>∴ If there be righteousness in the heart, there will be peace in the world.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Here is an argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some pigs have wings. Everything with wings can fly. So, some pigs can fly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the premises of this argument? What is its conclusion? Can you put it in premise-conclusion form? When you think you know the answer, click on the gray box below:</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>The premises are ‘Some pigs have wings’ and ‘Everything with wings can fly’. The conclusion is ‘Some pigs can fly’. In English, the words ‘so’ and ‘hence’ and ‘therefore’ are often used to indicate a conclusion. In this case, the fact that the last sentence begins with ‘So’ tells us that it is the conclusion.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Some pigs have wings.</li>
<li>Everything with wings can fly.</li>
<li>∴ Pigs can fly.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Here is another argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to raise the capital gains tax. We need to do this because a low capital gains tax provides a disproportionate benefit to the wealthiest citizens. It serves only to increase the gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of us, and we need to decrease that gap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the premises of this argument? What is the conclusion?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>The conclusion is, ‘We need to raise the capital gains tax.’ Notice that when people give arguments, they don’t always state the conclusion last, and they don’t always mark it with a word like ‘so’ or ‘therefore’.</p>
<p>The first premise is ‘A low capital gains tax provides a disproportionate benefit to the wealthiest citizens.’ Notice the way the word because is used to indicate that this is a premise—a bit of information that helps support the conclusion. Another word that often indicates a premise is ‘since’.</p>
<p>Here is the argument in premise-conclusion form:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A low capital gains tax provides a disproportionate benefit to the wealthiest citizens.</li>
<li>A low capital gains tax serves only to increase the gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of us.</li>
<li>We need to decrease the gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of us.</li>
<li>∴ We need to raise the capital gains tax.</li>

<p>You are probably familiar with the saying “Garbage in, garbage out”. When you reason <em>from</em> false premises, it doesn’t matter how well you reason. You’ll have no reason to suppose that your conclusion is true.</p>
<p>But suppose the information you plug into the premise box is true. Still things can go wrong: you might reason badly from those premises to your conclusion:</p>

</svg>
<p>When we reason correctly from true premises, we can be confident that our conclusion is true.</p>
<p>Now for some examples. Consider the argument,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>No mammals lay eggs.</li>
<li>All platypus are mammals.</li>
<li>∴ All platypus don’t lay eggs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here the reasoning is good. The conclusion <em>follows</em> from the premises: if they were both true, it would have to be true too. But the first premise is false. So this is a case of reasoning well from bad information. As you can see, it led us to a false conclusion.</p>
<p>Or consider,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All ducks are mammals.</li>
<li>All mammals are birds.</li>
<li>∴ All ducks are birds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, the reasoning is good. The conclusion <em>follows</em> from the premises: if they were both true, it would have to be true too. But again, we are reasoning from false premises. So this is a case of reasoning well from bad information. As you can see, we happened to be led to a true conclusion, but only by accident.</p>
<p>Here is an argument with true premises:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Some ducks are birds.</li>
<li>No birds are mammals.</li>
<li>∴ No ducks are mammals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here the premises are true, and the conclusion is true. But does the conclusion <em>follow</em> from the premises, or is this a case of bad reasoning?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>The conclusion does not follow. Suppose that some ducks were birds and some ducks were mammals. Then the premises would be true, but the conclusion false. So this is an example of bad reasoning from good information. The conclusion happens to be true, but only by accident.</p>
</div>
<p>One last example. Consider the argument,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Obama is President.</li>
<li>If Obama is President, then a Democrat is President.</li>
<li>∴ A Democrat is President.</li>
</ol>
<p>The premises are both true. And the conclusion follows from the premises: there is no way that they could be true but it false. So the conclusion is true, and it doesn’t just happen to be true. It’s truth was necessitated by the truth of the premises. So, finally, we have an example of good reasoning from good information!</p>
<h2 id="soundness-and-validity">Soundness and Validity</h2>
<p>As we have seen, arguments are kind of like friends. A friend can be good in one way but bad in another—a good listener but bad at keeping secrets, for example. And an argument can be good in one way but bad in another—good reasoning but bad premises, or good premises but bad reasoning.</p>
<p>It is helpful to introduce some technical terms. We will call an argument that has good reasoning a <strong>valid</strong> argument. And we will call an argument that has good reasoning from good premises a <strong>sound</strong> argument.</p>
<p>So this argument is sound:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Obama is President.</li>
<li>If Obama is President, then a Democrat is President.</li>
<li>∴ A Democrat is President.</li>
</ol>
<p>And these arguments are valid but not sound:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>No mammals lay eggs.</li>
<li>All platypus are mammals.</li>
<li>∴ All platypus don’t lay eggs.</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All ducks are mammals.</li>
<li>All mammals are birds.</li>
<li>∴ All ducks are birds.</li>
</ol>
<p>While this argument is neither valid nor sound:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Some ducks are birds.</li>
<li>No birds are mammals.</li>
<li>∴ No ducks are mammals.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is clear enough what it is for an argument has good or bad premises: a good premise is a true premise, and a bad premise is a false premise. But what does it mean to say that an argument has good reasoning?</p>
<p>Reasoning is good when the conclusion “follows”. But even that is just a metaphor. When we put an argument in premise-conclusion form, the conclusion always comes after the premises, so in a sense it always “follows” the premises. But that isn’t what we mean when we say that the conclusion follows from the premises. So what do we mean?</p>
<p>Roughly, what we mean is that, if the premises <em>were</em> true, then the conclusion <em>would have to be</em> true too. That is, we mean that there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true, but the conclusion false. So let this be our official definition of “validity”:</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>An argument is <strong>valid</strong> just in case it is impossible for all of its premises to be true but its conclusion false.</p>
</div>
<p>Here is an example of an invalid argument:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If Obama is President, then a Democrat is President.</li>
<li>A Democrat is President.</li>
<li>∴ Obama is President.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I write this, (1), (2) and (3) are all true. But the reasoning is bad; the conclusion does not follow from the premises; the argument is not valid. This is because there is a possible situation in which the premises are all true, but the conclusion false. Can you describe such a situation?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>Any situation in which some Democrat other than Obama is President will do the trick.</p>
</div>
<p>In general, you cannot tell whether or not an argument is valid just by considering whether or not its premises and conclusion are actually true or false. Validity is about what is or isn’t <em>possible</em>, not just about what happens to be the case. So you have to consider all the possibilities; you have to use your imagination.</p>
<p>Now that we have an official definition of validity, it is easy to provide an official definition of soundness:</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>An argument is <strong>sound</strong> just in case it is valid and all of its premises are true.</p>
</div>
<p>Remember, a sound argument is an argument with good reasoning—that is, a valid argument—from good information—that is, true premises.</p>
<p>In philosophy—and, indeed, in daily life—we want our arguments to be sound. As responsible reasoners, we want to be reasoning <em>validly</em> from <em>true</em> premises, since that ensures that we have reached a <em>true</em> conclusion. We want to put good information into our reasoning machine, and we want our machine to process that information correctly, so we get good information out of the machine.</p>
<p>But there is no general logical theory that allows us to assess whether or not a given premise is true or false. If you want to know whether or not all mammals lay eggs, you need to ask a biologist, not a logician. And there is no way to determine, using logic alone, who happens to be President, whether Andrew is vegetarian, and so on.</p>
<p>What logic <em>can</em> provide is a theory of good reasoning—a theory of validity, a theory of what follows from what.</p>

<p><em>Whether the premises be true or false, is not a question of logic, but of morals, philosophy, history or any other knowledge to which their subject-matter belongs. The question of logic is: does the conclusion certainly follow if the premises be true?</em></p>
</div>
<p>Let’s work through some more examples.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../../images/nocars.png" alt="No Cars Allowed" />
<p class="caption">No Cars Allowed</p>
</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>No cars are allowed in the park.</li>
<li>All police cruisers are cars.</li>
<li>Therefore, all police cruisers are not allowed in the park.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Is this argument valid? If it is not valid, can you describe a situation in which the premises are all true, but the conclusion false? If is valid, is it also sound?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>It is valid. It is hard to say whether or not it is sound. Premise (2) is true, but without further information about the park and its rules, we don’t know whether or not premise (1) is true. But if we can trust the sign, then the premises are both true, and the argument is valid, so it is sound.</p>
</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Some pigs have wings.</li>
<li>Everything with wings can fly.</li>
<li>∴ Some pigs can fly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this argument valid? If it is not valid, can you describe a situation in which the premises are all true, but the conclusion false? If is valid, is it also sound?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>It is valid, but it is not sound, because both of the premises are false (can you explain why is (2) false?)</p>
</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A good university must have a good library.</li>
<li>ISU has a good library.</li>
<li>∴ ISU is a good university.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this argument valid? If it is not valid, can you describe a situation in which the premises are all true, but the conclusion false? If is valid, is it also sound?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>It is not valid. Consider a possible situation in which ISU has a good library, and a good university must have a good library <em>and</em> a good philosophy department, but ISU does not have a good philosophy department. In that situation, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.</p>
<p>(Since it is not valid, it can’t be sound, so we don’t need to worry about whether or not the premises are actually true.)</p>
</div>
<p>Can a valid argument have a false conclusion? If so, what would an example be?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>Yes, a valid argument can have a false conclusion. We’ve already seen an example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Some pigs have wings.</li>
<li>Everything with wings can fly.</li>
<li>∴ Some pigs can fly.</li>
</ol>
<p>To check if the example you came up with was correct, ask yourself two questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is the conclusion false?</li>
<li>If all the premises were true, would the conclusion have to be true?</li>
</ol>
<p>If the answer to both of these question is yes, then your example was correct.</p>
</div>
<p>Can a valid argument with all true premises have a false conclusion? If so, what would an example be?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>No! If the argument is valid, then there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true, but the conclusion false.</p>
</div>
<p>Can a valid argument have false premises but a true conclusion? If so, what would an example be?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>Yes! Here is one example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Fish are mammals.</li>
<li>Whales are fish.</li>
<li>∴ Whales are mammals.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Suppose you know that an argument is sound. What do you know about its conclusion? Stop and think about this—the answer is implicit in the definitions of validity and soundness just given.</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>If an argument is sound, all of its premises are true and it is valid. That is (plugging in the definition of validity), all of its premises are true and it is impossible for all of its premises to be true but its conclusion false. So if an argument is sound, we know that its conclusion is true.</p>
</div>
<p>It is easy to come up with a <em>valid</em> argument for the existence of God, but hard to come up with an uncontroversially <em>sound</em> argument for the existence of God. Try it! Try to formulate a <em>valid</em> argument whose conclusion is ‘God exists’. Are the premises uncontroversially true?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>That was an open-ended question, so I hope you didn’t click on this box hoping for an answer! Here is one example of a valid argument for the existence of God:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The moon is made of green cheese.</li>
<li>If the moon is made of green cheese, then God exists.</li>
<li>∴ God exists.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is valid—-if the premises were true, the conclusion would have to be true too. But the first premise is clearly false, so the argument is not sound.</p>
<p>Here is another example of a valid argument for the existence of God:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Bible says God exists.</li>
<li>Everything the Bible says is true.</li>
<li>∴ God exists.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, this is valid—if the premises were true, the conclusion would have to be true too. But is it sound? Are the premises true? Some Christians believe that it is—they believe that both premises are true. But many Christians and most non-Christians will reject premise (2), claiming that it is false. Who’s right and who’s wrong? Ask the philosophers and theologians: that’s not a question that logic can answer.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>Famously, Paul says, in Titus 1:12-13,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. This witness is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what the Cretan said cannot be true! This is an example of the Liar Paradox (though it is not clear whether Paul meant it to be so). When Paul says “This witness is true,” that is, that what the Cretan said was true, he says something false.</p>
<p>So perhaps logic can show that not everything said by Paul in the Bible is true. Does that show that (2) is false?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again, it is easy to come up with a <em>valid</em> argument for the non-existence of God, but hard to come up with an uncontroversially <em>sound</em> argument for that same conclusion. Try it!</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>Here is an example of a valid argument that is obviously unsound:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The moon is made of green cheese.</li>
<li>If the moon is made of green cheese, then God doesn’t exist.</li>
<li>∴ God doesn’t exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example of a valid argument whose soundness is unclear:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If God existed, there would be no evil in the world.</li>
<li>There is evil in the world.</li>
<li>∴ God does not exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some philosophers argue that (1) and (2) are both true, and so the argument is sound. Others reject the truth of (1) or (2), claiming that the argument is valid but not sound. Who’s right and who’s wrong? Again, not a question that can be answered by logic alone.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="review-and-loose-ends">Review and Loose Ends</h2>
<p>Weve introduced five key terms: <strong>argument</strong>, <strong>premise</strong>, <strong>conclusion</strong>, <strong>valid</strong>, <strong>sound</strong>. The first three are defined in terms of each other:</p>
<div class="boxed">
<dl>
<dt><strong>Arguments, Premises, Conclusions</strong></dt>
<dd>An <strong>argument</strong> is piece of reasoning that can be represented as a list of sentences, called the <strong>premises</strong>, followed by a sentence, called the <strong>conclusion</strong>.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Validity</strong></dt>
<dd>An argument is <strong>valid</strong> just in case it is impossible that all the premises be true but the conclusion false.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Soundness</strong></dt>
<dd>An argument is <strong>sound</strong> just in case it is valid and all of its premises are true.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Finally, we should briefly wrap up two loose ends.</p>
<p>First, the sentences that play the role of premises or conclusions must be sentences that express information. So they have to be <em>declarative sentences</em>—the kinds of sentences that are true or false. They cannot be questions or commands, since questions and commands are not used to express information.</p>
<p>So this is <em>not</em> an argument:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It is important to eat fruits and vegetables.</li>
<li>∴ Eat your fruits and vegetables!</li>
</ol>
<p>Why not?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>This is not an argument because the conclusion is an imperative sentence—a sentence used to give a command—rather than a declarative sentence—a sentence used to say something true or false.</p>
<p>It is possible to develop a logic that includes imperatives. Computer programming languages often involve imperatives. Consider:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If the user clicks on the icon, then open the app!</li>
<li>The user has clicked on the icon.</li>
<li>∴ Open the app!</li>
</ol>
<p>We might think of this as an argument from one imperative—the command expressed by (1)—to another imperative—the command expressed by (3). But the logic of imperatives (like the logic of questions) is an advanced topic, to be considered after you have mastered the material of this course.</p>
</div>
<p>Second, we said above that good reasoning is <em>valid</em> reasoning, and we gave an official definition of validity. But not all good reasoning is valid in our sense.</p>
<p>Consider an eighteenth century European biologist, who has made a wide and careful study of mammals, and never encountered a mammal that lays eggs. Suppose she infers that no mammals lay eggs:</p>

<p>This seems like a reasonable inference for her to have made: it was based on a large set of good data, carefully gathered and considered. But it is not a valid inference: it is quite possible—and in this case, what actually happens—that the premises all be true but the conclusion false.</p>
<p>Or consider a scientist who is interested in explaining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event">Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event</a>: the mass extinction that wiped out all the dinosaurs (except the birds, of course). The evidence strongly suggests that the extinction was caused, at least in part, by the impact of a large asteroid. So the scientist infers that the extinction was probably caused by a large asteroid.</p>
<p>Again, this seems like a reasonable inference. But it is not a <em>valid</em> inference in our sense. It is <em>possible</em> that, despite all the evidence, the extinction was caused by something else.</p>
<p>These examples show that not all good reasoning is valid reasoning. Some good reasoning is probabilistic or inductive: the given information <em>supports</em> a certain conclusion, but not absolutely, as there is still the chance that the conclusion is false despite the evidence.</p>
<p>The study of this kind of reasoning is the domain of inductive logic and probability theory. We are not going to be studying inductive logic or probability theory. We are going to be studying <em>deductive</em> logic. Deductive logic attempts to provide a theory of validity—iron-clad reasoning where the premises leave no possibility that the conclusion be false.</p>
<h1 id="logical-form-and-formal-validity">Logical Form and Formal Validity</h1>
<p>Often, the validity of an argument is connected to its <strong>logical form</strong>. Both of our sample arguments from the previous section—the one about the cars and the one about the platypus—have the same logical form. Consider:</p>
<div class="cor">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>No <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="cars"> are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" style="width:10em" placeholder="allowed in the park">.</li>
<li>All <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" style="width:8em" placeholder="police cruisers"> are <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="cars">.</li>
<li>Therefore, all <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" style="width:8em" placeholder="police cruisers"> are not <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" style="width:10em" placeholder="allowed in the park">.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the boxes above is actually a text input box: you can type in anything you want. Try replacing <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="cars"> with ‘mammals’, <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" style="width:10em" placeholder="allowed in the park"> with ‘egg-layers’, and <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" style="width:8em" placeholder="police cruisers"> with ‘platypus’.</p>
</div>
<p>Play around with it: plug in any terms—that is, any common nouns or noun phrases—into the form. Each time, note whether or not the premises and conclusion are true.</p>
<p>Now for a more focused challenge. Try plugging in terms that make the premises all true. Once you’ve done that, the conclusion will be specified. Is it true or false? Can you find terms that make all the premises true but the conclusion false?</p>
<p>Now try plugging in terms that make the conclusion false. Once you’ve done that, all but one of the terms will be specified. Can you find a value for that third term that makes one of the premises false?</p>
<p>This argument is <strong>formally valid</strong>: there is no argument of this form—no argument that you can get by plugging in different terms—that has true premises and a false conclusion.</p>
<div class=".cor">
<p>Here is another argument form that involves three terms:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>  Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"></li>
<li>  Some <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"> are <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
<li>∴ Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is not formally valid. Can you find values for <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As">, <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs">, and <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"> that make both of the premises true and the conclusion false?</p>
</div>
<div class="answers">
<p>Here is one way to do it: let ‘As’ be ‘cats’; let ‘Bs’ be ‘animals’; let ‘Cs’ be ‘dogs’.</p>
</div>
<p>In the previous section, we saw that validity had to do with what is or isn’t possible: is it possible that all the premises be true but the conclusion false? Figuring out what is or isn’t possible requires a lot of imagination, and it isn’t always clear what we should say.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>But formal validity is more straightforward.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<dl>
<dt><strong>Formal Validity</strong></dt>
<dd>An argument is <strong>formally valid</strong> just in case there is no argument with the same logical form that has all true premises and a false conclusion.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>We can test the formal validity of an argument by trying to find an argument that has the same logical form whose premises are <em>actually</em> true, and whose conclusion is <em>actually</em> false.</p>
<p>Let’s practice.</p>
<p>The following form is invalid. Show this by finding values for ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ that make the premises true and the conclusion false.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>  Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"></li>
<li>   All <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"> are not <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
<li>∴  All <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are not <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
</ol>
<div class="answers">
<p>Here is one way to do it: let ‘A’ be ‘numbers’, ‘B’ be ‘odd numbers’, and ‘C’ be ‘divisible by two’. Then the premises are both true, but the conclusion is false.</p>
<p>Here is another way to do it: let ‘A’ be ‘animals’, ‘B’ be ‘dogs’, and ‘C’ be ‘cats’.</p>
</div>
<p>Is this form valid? Try to find values for ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ that make the premises true and the conclusion false.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>  All <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"></li>
<li>  All <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"> are <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
<li>∴ All <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
</ol>
<div class="answers">
<p>The form is valid. No matter what nouns you plug in for ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’, if the premises are true, the conclusion will be true too. Aristotle called this argument form “Barbara”.</p>
<p>Notice that we cannot really <em>show</em> that the argument is valid. All we can do is try to come up with an example that shows that it is invalid. When we cannot come up with any such examples, how can we be sure that this is not simply due to our lack of imagination?</p>
</div>
<p>Is this form valid?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>  Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"></li>
<li>∴ Some <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"> are <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"></li>
</ol>
<div class="answers">
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="sentential-logic-if-and-not">Sentential Logic: ‘if’ and ‘not’</h1>
<p>In the previous section, we took the common nouns that occurred in an argument—words like platypus and police car—to be the non-logical <em>content</em> of an argument—and we took the words that surrounded them—words like all, some, no, not, and are—to indicate the logical form of the argument.</p>
<p>The resulting logic is called <strong>Term Logic</strong> (or sometimes <strong>Aristotelean Logic</strong>, because this was the sort of logic that Aristotle developed). It is also called <strong>Traditional Logic</strong>, because it was the logic most widely used throughout the medieval and early modern periods. But this is not the only way one might think about logical form.</p>
<div class="cor">
<p>Consider the following argument:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width:12em" placeholder="the governor is corrupt">, then <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width:17em" placeholder="he should be thrown in prison">.</li>
<li><input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width:12em" placeholder="the governor is corrupt"></li>
<li>∴ <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width:17em" placeholder="he should be thrown in prison">.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is valid: any possible situation that makes both premises true makes the conclusion true too.</p>
<p>Further, the argument is formally valid. Replace <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width:12em" placeholder="the governor is corrupt"> with any sentence, and <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width:17em" placeholder="he should be thrown in prison"> with any sentence, and the resulting argument will also be valid. Try it, by typing in other sentences into the box and the circle.</p>
</div>
<p>Here is another argument, similar but slightly different in form:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If capital punishment deterred crimes, then it is justified.</li>
<li>Capital punishment does not deter crimes.</li>
<li>∴ Capital punishment is not justified.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this argument valid? The answer may not be immediately obvious. We can represent the form of the argument as,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text">, then <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text"></li>
<li>It is not the case that <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text"></li>
<li>∴ It is not the case that <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text"></li>
</ol>
<p>Can you find sentences that, when plugged into the box and circle, make the premises true but the conclusion false? (Note that the box and circle are still interactive: you can type sentences into them.)</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>Try plugging in ‘Hilary Clinton is President’ into the box and ‘a Democrat is President’ into the circle. Then the premises are both true, but the conclusion is false.</p>
</div>
<p>This invalid form of argument is a fairly common <strong>logical fallacy</strong>—that is, logical mistake people make when reasoning. It is common enough that it has a name: <em>denying the antecedent</em>.</p>
<p>To understand that name, you need to know a few more technical terms. We call an ‘if … then …’ sentence a <strong>conditional</strong>. We call the ‘if’-part of a conditional the <strong>antecedent</strong>, and we call the ‘then’-part the <strong>consequent</strong>. So, for example, here is a conditional:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Bonzo is an ape, then he should go to bed,</li>
</ul>
<p>The antecedent is ‘Bonzo is an ape’. The consequent is ‘Bonzo should go to bed’. So, to <em>deny</em> the antecedent of this conditional would be to say that the Bonzo is not an ape.</p>
<p>Here are four common forms of argument that involve conditionals. Which are valid and which are invalid?</p>

<p>Which of these four forms are valid, and which invalid? Try to work out your answer before clicking the box below.</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>The first and last forms, with the weird Latin names, are valid. The other two are invalid. For the invalid forms, can you come up with sentences that make the premises true but the conclusion false?</p>
</div>
<p>There are other ways to combine sentences to form new more complicated sentences. For example, given the sentences <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder="Bonzo is an ape"> and <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder="Reagan was President">, we can form sentences like,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder="Bonzo is an ape"> and <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder="Reagan was President">.</p></li>
<li><p><input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder="Bonzo is an ape"> or <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder="Reagan was President">.</p></li>
<li><p><input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder="Bonzo is an ape"> just in case <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder="Reagan was President">.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These examples all share an important feature: the truth or falsehood of the complex sentence is a function of the truth or falsehood of its component parts.</p>
<p>This isn’t always true. Consider,</p>
<ul>
<li><input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 22em" placeholder="Renacci voted against the gun control bill"> because <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder="The NRA gave Renacci $9,900">.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of the component sentences are true. The NRA gave Senator Jim Renacci $9,900 in support of his 2012 election campaign, and Renacci voted against a gun control bill. But that is not enough to tell us whether or not the complex sentence is true, whether the contribution in fact influenced his vote.</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>The aim of this page was to provide you a first introduction to logic. Key terms that were defined include <strong>logic</strong>, <strong>argument</strong>, <strong>premise</strong>, <strong>conclusion</strong>, <strong>valid</strong>, <strong>sound</strong>, <strong>formally valid</strong>, <strong>conditional</strong>, <strong>antecedent</strong>, and <strong>consequent</strong>. You were introduced to two kinds of logical form—the sort studied by term logic and the sort studied by sentential logic. In the next chapter, we will begin developing sentential logic.</p>

<h1 id="course-content">Course Content</h1>
<p>Philosophy 112 is entitled “Language, Logic, and Mathematics”, but it is primarily a course in logic. <em>Logic</em> is the study of correct and incorrect reasoning. Logicians want to understand what makes good reasoning good and what makes bad reasoning bad. Understanding this allows us to avoid making mistakes in our own reasoning, and it allows us to evaluate the reasoning of others. But the importance of logic goes far beyond these narrow goals: it lies at the foundation of mathematics, linguistics, cognitive science, computer science, and philosophy.</p>
<p>This course provides an introduction to the basic concepts and methods used by logicians. The focus will be on <em>formal</em> or <em>symbolic</em> logic. We will start by exploring the logic of ‘not’, ‘if’, ‘and’, ‘or’, and ‘if and only if’, before going on to explore the logic of ‘every’ and ‘some’. You will learn how to symbolize arguments in a way that makes their logical form perspicuous, and you will learn techniques for determining whether or not a given argument is good or bad.</p>
<h1 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h1>
<p>This course is both a GE course in the category of Quantitative Reasoning, and a course required for the philosophy major. Here is how the University describes the category:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In Quantitative Reasoning courses, students examine the principles, practices, instruments, and systems of mathematics and logic used to measure, quantify, analyze, and represent social, scientific, technological, and other phenomena as a basis for decision-making.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever your major, this course will make you a better reasoner. You will learn how to formally represent a given line of reasoning, and evaluate whether it is good or bad. You will get better at seeing how different pieces of information can “fit together” to entail further new information. Although this course has no writing component, many of you will find that it improves your analytic writing skills, as you get a better sense of how to marshal evidence in support of a conclusion.</p>
<p>Again, no matter your major, this course will give you exposure to and appreciation of the methods of symbolic logic. Though much of our time will be spent learning <em>how to do</em> logic, we will occasionally step back and reflect on the relevance of logic to broader questions about the nature of language, the nature of truth, and the nature of rationality.</p>
<p>The course will also enable you to read and understand modern symbolic logic—a skill somewhat akin to the ability to read and understand algebraic formulas. This is valuable in its own right, as it gives you a powerful way of thinking about the form your reasoning takes, just as algebra gives you a powerful way of thinking about certain mathematical relationships, and geometric gives you a powerful way of thinking about spatial relationships. This is skill is especially essential for philosophy majors, as contemporary work in philosophy assumes a basic literacy in symbolic logic.</p>
<p>For the philosophy major, this course can either be seen as a useful supplement to other philosophy courses, or as the gateway to some of the more “technical” fields in contemporary philosophy, such as Philosophy of Language, Philosophy of Math, and Philosophical Logic, and the more “technical” parts of contemporary Philosophy of Mind, Epistemology (the Theory of Knowledge), and Metaphysics (the Theory of Being).</p>
<h1 id="course-requirements">Course Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="software-and-text">Software and Text</h2>
<p>You do not need to purchase a text for this course. You do need to download a free software program:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu">Logic 2010: A Workbook</a>: <a href="http://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu">http://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The software runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems (if you need help getting it set up on Linux, ask), but it will not run on iOS, Android, or on Chromebooks. The software requires Java. Before installing, be sure to read the instructions on the download page for your operating system, and be sure to read the document, <a href="https://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu/Logic/Documents/CORE/Vanilla_Installing_Starting_..._LOGIC_2010_v1.pdf">Installing, Starting, Registering, and Backing Up in Logic 2010.</a>, which is linked to at the top of the download page.</p>
<p>The software comes with a free online textbook, <em>An Exposition of Symbolic Logic</em>, by Terry Parsons. I will refer to this book as “the Logic Text”. The documentation that comes with the software sometimes refers to it as the Logic Text and sometimes refers to it as the “Terry Text”. Once you have installed the software, you can access the Logic Text by clicking on the “Logic Text” button. I have also posted copies of the text to <a href="http://www.davidsanson.com/112">Reggienet</a>, under “Resources and Materials”.</p>
<p>The software and the Logic Text are both based off of one of the classic logic textbooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donald Kalish, Richard Montague, and Gary Mar (1980). <em>Logic: Techniques of Formal Reasoning</em>, 2nd edition. Harcourt: Fort Worth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="graded-assignments">Graded Assignments</h2>
<p>Your grade will be based on homework, quizzes, and exams, broken down as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Homework</strong></dt>
<dd>20%
</dd>
<dt><strong>First Midterm</strong> (Monday, 9/23)</dt>
<dd>20%
</dd>
<dt><strong>Second Midterm</strong> (Monday, 10/28)</dt>
<dd>20%
</dd>
<dt><strong>Final</strong> (Finals Week)</dt>
<dd>40%
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please note that failure to attend class can also effect your grade, as explained below.</p>
<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
<p>Homework will be due twice a week. Most homework will be completed and submitted using the Logic 2010 software, and due by midnight the day before class. Some homework will be completed via ReggieNet, in the form of short online “Quizzes”. Occasionally, homework will be completed on paper and submitted in class. <strong>Late homework will automatically receive 0 points</strong>.</p>
<p>Learning how to <em>do</em> logic requires practice—much like learning a foreign language or learning algebra. Think of the homework assignments as the <strong>BARE MINIMUM</strong> you need to do to scrape by. You should be completing additional exercises on your own. The Logic software includes many exercises, only some of which will be assigned as homework. The Logic Text includes several additional exercises, and you should make a habit of completing those exercises as you read through the text.</p>
<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>
<p>Exams will be closed-notes and closed-book and in class, completed without the aid of software. You will need to supply your own bluebooks for the exams.</p>
<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
<p>Attendance is required. You are allowed up to five unexcused absences without penalty. After that, each absence will result in the loss of a full letter grade in the course. So if you have six unexcused absences, the highest grade you can get in a B; if you have seven, a C; eight, a D; nine, an F.</p>
<h2 id="course-difficultly-and-course-speed">Course Difficultly and Course Speed</h2>
<p>Many of you will find this course quite challenging. Logic is partly about mathematics—we will be solving puzzlings that require recognition and manipulation of abstract patterns. And it is partly about language—we will be looking at sentences of English, trying to understand what they mean, and then attempting to represent them in an unfamiliar symbolic language.</p>
<p>I try to keep the course moving at an appropriate rate: I want most of you to feel constantly challenged, but not overwhelmed. Some of you will find the rate too fast, and will begin to feel overwhelmed. If this happens to you, please come to my office hours, or contact the tutors, and get help. Sometimes, we just need to spend some time working through the problems one-on-one to help get things to click.</p>
<p>Some of you may find the rate too slow, and begin to get bored. Again, come talk to me: there is a lot more to logic than what we will manage to cover in this course, and I’d be happy to work out an accelerated program that allows you to go further and dig deeper.</p>
<h1 id="course-websites">Course Websites</h1>
<p>There are three websites associated with this course. The main course website is on Reggienet:</p>
<p><a href="https://reggienet.illinoisstate.edu">https://reggienet.illinoisstate.edu</a></p>
<p>The ReggieNet page is a traditional course webpage. It contains a copy of this syllabus, course announcements, and so on. There is also a webpage associated with the software,</p>
<p><a href="http://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu">http://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu</a></p>
<p>This is where you will go to find your homework assignments, and to verify that your work has been submitted.</p>
<p>Finally, I will post documents designed to supplement the textbook to my personal website,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidsanson.com/logic">http://www.davidsanson.com/logic</a></p>
<h1 id="getting-in-touch">Getting in Touch</h1>
<p>Email is the best way to reach me when I am not in my office. I am not always online and I cannot always respond immediately. If I have not responded in 24 hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won’t take this as harassment). Include “112” in the subject line of your email and your full name somewhere in the body of your email, so I know who you are(!), and that the email is related to this class.</p>
<p>There is also a “Feedback” button within the Logic 2010 software, that allows you to send an email both to me and to the authors of the software program.</p>
<h1 id="disabilities">Disabilities</h1>
<p>Any student needing to arrange a reasonable accommodation for a documented disability should contact Disability Concerns at 350 Fell Hall, 309‐438‐5853, <a href="http://www.disabilityconcerns.ilstu.edu">http://www.disabilityconcerns.ilstu.edu</a>.</p>
<h1 id="other-sources-of-support">Other Sources of Support</h1>
<p>Life at college can get very complicated. Students sometimes feel overwhelmed, lost, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationship difficulties or diminished self-esteem. Many of these issues can be effectively addressed with a little help. Student Counseling Services (SCS) helps students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. Student Counseling Services is staffed by experienced, professional psychologists and counselors, who are attuned to the needs of college students. The services are free and completely confidential. Find out more at <a href="http://counseling.illinoisstate.edu">http://counseling.illinoisstate.edu</a> or by calling 309-438-3655.</p>
<h1 id="academic-misconduct">Academic Misconduct</h1>
<p>Academic integrity is expected and required. Students are expected to be honest in all academic work. A student’s placement of his or her name on any academic exercise shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result of the student’s own thought, effort, and study.</p>
<p>If you have questions, refer to the Code of Student Conduct, B1 (Academic Integrity), which outlines unacceptable behaviors in academic matters, or talk to me. In certain circumstances (such as cheating or plagiarism) I may be required to refer a student to Community Rights &amp; Responsibilities for a violation of Illinois State University’s Code of Student Conduct.</p>

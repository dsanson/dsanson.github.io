These are flashcards for students in my Philosophy 112.
</p>
<p>
The flashcards are plaintext files. Each line contains two items,
separated by a colon, e.g.,
</p>
<pre><code>~~P &#8756 P; Double Negation Elimination (DNE)</code></pre>
<p>
<p>
The item before the colon is meant to be the "front" of the flashcard. The item after the colon is meant to be the "back" of the flashcard.
</p>
Various flashcard apps are able to import such files, including
<a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a>, which is free and
cross-platform. There are also web-based services that can import such
files, like <a href="http://www.cram.com/flashcards/create">Cram</a>.
